#There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
#List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
#Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

#Create and print a dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

#Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

#Duplicate values заменяют имеющиеся:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)
#To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(len(thisdict))
#The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:
#type()
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(type(thisdict))
#dict()
#Using the dict() method to make a dictionary:

thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)
#Accessing Items
#Get the value of the "model" key:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]
#get()
x = thisdict.get("model")
#keys()
#Get a list of the keys:

x = thisdict.keys()

#Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.keys()

print(x) #before the change

car["color"] = "white"

print(x) #after the change

#values()
#Get a list of the values:

x = thisdict.values()
#Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

car["year"] = 2020

print(x) #after the change

#Get a list of the key:value pairs
# items()
x = thisdict.items()
#Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.items()

print(x) #before the change

car["year"] = 2020

print(x) #after the change
#Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")
#update()also can add
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"year": 2020})
#pop()
#The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)
#The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)
#The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)
#The clear() method empties the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)
#for ,Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)
#Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])
#You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)

#You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)

#Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)
#copy()method
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)
#dict()
#Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

#Nested Dictionaries
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
print(myfamily)
#Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:

child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007

  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3

print(myfamily)

#Print the name of child 2:

print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])

#items()Loop through the keys and values of all nested dictionaries:
for x, obj in myfamily.items():
  print(x)

  for y in obj:
    print(y + ':', obj[y])

#Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.
